# HousingPriceSimulteneityProject
Housing prices, construction costs, and labor costs likely have feedback effects between them. I set up a theoretical model to represent these feedback effects and simulate it in Python. The feedback effects lead to endogeneity(simultaneity) issues if a standard regression technique such as Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) is used. This leads to biased results but this can be fixed with Two-Stage Least Squares(2SLS). Understanding the endogeneity in housing markets is important for stakeholders in the housing sector because ignoring these issues can lead to incorrect conclusions.
